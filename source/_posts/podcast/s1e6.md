## Summary
In this conversation, Bartosz and Borja discuss common security mistakes in web application development and how developers can enhance security in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). They highlight the importance of security awareness and training for developers, as well as the need for architectural reviews and threat modeling exercises. They also mention the value of integrating static code analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities. The conversation emphasizes the need for developers to be aware of security issues and to collaborate with security experts to ensure the security of their applications. In this conversation, Bartek and Borja discuss incident response and management in the context of web application security. They cover topics such as integrating security tools into development pipelines, evaluating the risk and impact of security issues, incident response planning, and the importance of post-mortem analysis. They also touch on the role of web application firewalls (WAFs) and the rising threats in the cybersecurity landscape.

## Takeaways
- **Simplify** and reduce the **attack surface** by eliminating unmaintained code and applications.
- Developers should be **aware** of security issues and receive **training** to prevent common security mistakes.
- **Architectural reviews** and threat modeling exercises are valuable for identifying **vulnerabilities**.
- Avoid exposing information that can aid malicious actors, such as through error messages or **enumeration**. Security **awareness** and training are crucial for preventing and mitigating cybersecurity risks.
- **Penetration testing** helps identify vulnerabilities in web applications and allows for proactive security measures.
- Having an **incident response plan** is essential for effectively managing and responding to security incidents.
- Post-incident **analysis** and lessons learned are important for improving security practices and preventing future incidents.
- Web application **firewalls (WAFs)** can provide some level of protection, but they are not foolproof and should not be relied upon as the sole security measure.
- The increasing **interconnectedness** of systems and the proliferation of web applications pose ongoing security challenges.
