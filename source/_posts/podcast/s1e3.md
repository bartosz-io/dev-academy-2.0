## Summary

In this conversation, Anderson Dadario, the founder of DevOps.security, discusses the importance of integrating security into the software development process. He explains the differences between traditional DevOps and DevSecOps, emphasizing the need for security by design and shifting security left in the development cycle. Anderson also provides insights into conducting a threat modeling exercise for a web application, identifying potential risks, and implementing mitigation techniques. He highlights the importance of understanding the business requirements and balancing security measures with the risk appetite of the company. Additionally, he suggests quick wins for developers to integrate security into their DevOps workflow. The conversation covers different approaches to threat modeling, common security vulnerabilities for developers, spectacular exploitation situations, and final thoughts and resources.
