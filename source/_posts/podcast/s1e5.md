## Summary
The principle of least privilege is a key component of the zero trust architecture and mentality in software development. It is important to minimize access to the bare minimum that is needed to reduce the attack surface. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a commonly used approach where permissions are assigned to users based on their roles. Hierarchical RBAC adds a hierarchy to roles, allowing for more granularity. Attribute-based access control (ABAC) focuses on conditions and attributes to determine access. ABAC is useful for dynamic scenarios and can be combined with RBAC for more complex policies. Access control models, such as RBAC and ABAC, will continue to evolve as applications and technology change. The future of access control will involve more non-deterministic AI agents acting as users and integrations. Policy models will merge together and be simplified, focusing on groups, patterns of usage, and levels of usage. It is important for developers to stay up to date with security standards and best practices. Utilizing open source tools and connecting with their communities is a great way to stay informed. Additionally, engaging in discussions with other developers and seeking guidance can help navigate the complexities of access control.
