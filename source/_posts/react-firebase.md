# Build a To-Do Application with React and Firebase

To-do applications are one of the ways you can use to manage a set of tasks. As developers, learning how to build a to-do application will also help to understand certain concepts one of which includes an understanding of how to build a To-do application.

In this article, you will learn how to build a to-do web app by making use of React.js and Firebase Database.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

To install the **npm** packages needed for this React application such as Firebase, you need to have Node.js downloaded.

Visual Studio code serves as the code editor we will use to build this project.

The Firebase Console serves as the backend as a service database that helps us to store and manage our data, through the use of the Cloud Firestore.

## How to Setup the Firebase Project

To set up firebase, you head to the [firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) website and create a new project by using your Google account. Once you are logged into firebase you will see an existing project, you can click on the **add project** button, as seen below.

{% img "recent-projects.png" "Firebase console dashboard" "lazy" %}

After clicking on the add project button, we get navigated to a new page which requires 3 steps before the firebase project is created:
- The first step requires us to name the firebase project, which we will call **todo**.
- The second step asks if we want to enable Google Analytics, you should disable it by using the toggle button.
- Finally, we can now click on the **create project** button.
Once the project is created, we click on the continue button which navigates us to the next screen, which is now our default firebase project dashboard.
{% img "dashboard-landing.png" "Firebase dashboard" "lazy" %}
We have now completed the creation of a new Firebase project.

## Creating the Firestore Database
Inside the firebase dashboard, on the left-hand panel, we take the following steps:
- Click on the **Build** dropdown.
- Within the **Build** dropdown, select **Firestore Database**, this displays a page where we can click on the **Create database** button.
- Next, a modal pops up asking if we want **Production mode** or **Test mode**. You can choose Test mode since the app is currently in the development stage.
- The next step asks for where we want our Cloud Firestore to be located, you can choose the location closest to your area due to the possibility of latency.

Once we click on enable, we get redirected to the **Cloud Firestore** page which will currently have an empty Collection.

## How to Create the React Project

We are going to create a new React project by making use of CRA ([Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started)). Since we have **node.js** installed, we can run the following commands:

```properties
npm i create-react-app
```

Once the installation of CRA is complete, we can now create a new React project with the following command below:

```properties
npm init react-app todo
cd todo
code .
```

We have now created a new React project called **todo**, navigated into the project directory, and opened the project in Visual Studio Code.

We can now begin the setup of the React application.

## Setting up the Project Structure

To set up the architecture of our React project, you can implement the steps below:

- In the **src** directory, create two folders named **components** and **services.**
- The components folder will contain two new document files. The first js file is called **Todo.js**, while the second file is called **EditTodo.js**.
- In the services folder, create a js file called **firebase.config.js**. This file will contain the configuration of the firebase which we can export to different components.
- Finally, still within the **src** directory, we head to the **App.js** file. Here, we clear the boilerplate inside of the `div` with the `className` of *App* and then import the **Todo.js** component as seen in the following lines of code:

```javascript
import './App.css';
import Todo from './components/Todo';

  function App() {
   return (
   <div className="App">
   <Todo />
   </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

With the above, we now have the basic structure of our React project set up.

## How to Integrate Firebase in React

To add the firebase web SDK to our new app, the first thing we need to do is run the following command inside our terminal:

`npm install firebase`

Next, you open up the **firebase.config.js** file inside of the **services** folder and then use the following imports to configure firebase into the React app:

```javascript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";
```

Furthermore, you need to grab the project configuration settings from the firebase dashboard. On the left-hand panel of the dashboard, click on project overview and select project settings.

Scroll to the bottom of the page and select the web icon as shown below:

{% img "project-settings.png" "Web icon for firebase project settings" "lazy" %}

Once the web icon gets selected, a new page shows up asking you to give the app a nickname. You can proceed to call it **todo** or any other word you prefer, then click on **register app**. Firebase will now generate the firebase configuration settings, which contain the API key, storage bucket, auth domain, project id, app id, e.t.c as seen below:

{% img "firebase-config.png" "Firebase config settings" "lazy" %}

We can now grab this and paste it inside our **firebase.config.js** file:

```javascript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyC5u80wO6iaPl8E9auM0IRXliYGKyDQHfU",
    authDomain: "todo-b74fc.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "todo-b74fc",
    storageBucket: "todo-b74fc.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "872116099545",
    appId: "1:872116099545:web:9bb66d12ca15f2f39521c8"
};
```

The final step needed to complete the firebase configuration is to initialize firebase by making use of the config variable and then export it so it becomes available in all our components, as seen in the following lines of code:

```javascript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { getFirestore } from "firebase/firestore";

  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  const config = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyC5u80wO6iaPl8E9auM0IRXliYGKyDQHfU",
    authDomain: "todo-b74fc.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "todo-b74fc",
    storageBucket: "todo-b74fc.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "872116099545",
    appId: "1:872116099545:web:9bb66d12ca15f2f39521c8"
    };

  const app = initializeApp(config);

export const db = getFirestore(app);
```

With this, our firebase configuration is successfully created and we do not need to make use of any other firebase services.

## Integrate Bootstrap 5 into React

To integrate Bootstrap 5 you will need to head over to the [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) website and grab the CDN link for both the CSS and JavaScript. You can then head back to the React project in VS Code, open the public directory, and proceed to select the **index.html** file.

In the **index.html** file, we can paste the *CDN* links for both the **CSS** and **JavaScript** within the head section. With that we should have the result below:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC"crossorigin="anonymous">

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-MrcW6ZMFYlzcLA8Nl+NtUVF0sA7MsXsP1UyJoMp4YLEuNSfAP+JcXn/tWtIaxVXM" crossorigin="anonymous">
</script>
```

Now we have access to all Bootstrap 5 classes across our components.

## Designing the User Interface

To implement the design for the React project you will start by clearing the boilerplate code inside of the **App.css** file. You can now proceed to open the **index.css** file and then paste the following styles:

```css
body{
  margin-top:20px;
  background: #f8f8f8;
}

.todo-list {
   margin: 10px 0
}

.todo-list .todo-item {
  padding: 15px;
  margin: 5px 0;
  border-radius: 0;
}

div.checker {
  width: 18px;
  height: 18px
}

div.checker input{
  width: 18px;
  height: 18px
}

div.checker {
  display: inline-block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}

.done {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
```

Above, what we did was ensure all the elements that will be displayed on the browser are properly arranged.

Next, proceed to the **Todo.js** file and paste the code below within the return statement of the jsx:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

const Todo = () => {
return (
<>
 <div className="container">
  <div className="row">
    <div className="col-md-12">
      <div className="card card-white">
        <div className="card-body">
          <button
            data-bs-toggle="modal"
            data-bs-target="#addModal"
            type="button"
            className="btn btn-info">Add Todo
          </button>


    <div className="todo-list">
      <div className="todo-item">
        <hr />
        <span>
          <div className="checker" >
            <span className="" >
              <input
                type="checkbox"
              />
            </span>
          </div>
          &nbsp; Go hard or Go Home<br />
          <i>10/11/2022</i>
        </span>
        <span className=" float-end mx-3">
          <EditTodo /></span>
        <button
          type="button"
          className="btn btn-danger float-end">Delete
        </button>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  {/* Modal */}
  <div
   className="modal fade"
   id="addModal"
   tabIndex="-1"
   aria-labelledby="addModalLabel"
   aria-hidden="true">
  <div className="modal-dialog">
  <form className="d-flex">
    <div className="modal-content">
      <div className="modal-header">
  <h5
   className="modal-title"
   id="addModalLabel">
   Add Todo
  </h5>
  <button
     type="button"
     className="btn-close"
     data-bs-dismiss="modal"
     aria-label="Close">
  </button>
  </div>
  <div className="modal-body">
    <input
      type="text"
      className="form-control"
      placeholder="Add a Todo"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="modal-footer">
  <button
    className="btn btn-secondary"
    data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close
  </button>

  <button className="btn btn-primary">Create Todo</button>
          </div>
        </div>
      </form>
    </div>
  </div>
</>
  )
}
export default Todo
```

In the above code:

- The `div` with the `className` of `.container` displays the card that contains all items in our Todo list, while the `div` with the `id` of `addModal` contains the modal where all the **todo** can be created using the save button called **Add todo**.

The final part of our design is in the `EditTodo.js` file. The `EditTodo.js` file will only contain the modal that allows us to edit each **todo** list item. The code can be seen below:

```javascript
import React from 'react'

 const EditTodo = () => {

  return (
  <>
    <button
      type="button"
      className="btn btn-primary"
      data-bs-toggle="modal"
      data-bs-target="#exampleModal"
    >
      Edit Todo
    </button>

  <div
      className="modal fade"
      id="exampleModal"
      tabIndex="-1"
      aria-labelledby="editLabel"
      aria-hidden="true">
      <div className="modal-dialog">
        <div className="modal-content">
          <div className="modal-header">
            <h5
              className="modal-title"
               id="editLabel">
          Update Todo Details
            </h5>
    <button
        type="button"
        className="btn-close"
        data-bs-dismiss="modal"
        aria-label="Close">
    </button>
  </div>
    <div className="modal-body">

    <form className="d-flex">
      <input
        type="text"
        className="form-control"
      />
    </form>

  </div>
  <div className="modal-footer">
     <button
       type="button"
       className="btn btn-secondary"
       data-bs-dismiss="modal">Close
     </button>
      <button
        type="button"
        className="btn btn-primary"
      >Update Todo</button>
  </div>
        </div>
      </div>
  </div>
</>
      )
}

export default EditTodo
```

The design for the application is now complete. If you run the command `npm start` in the terminal and the code compiles, you should see the result below in the browser:

{% img "page.png" "Complete page design" "lazy" %}

## Adding Data to the Firestore in React

To implement the Add data functionality in our todo application, we start by importing some modules from `firebase/firestore` which can be seen below:

```javascript
import { collection, addDoc, serverTimestamp } from 'firebase/firestore'
```

- A `Collection` is a folder that contains **Documents** and Data. All the data saved on our Todo application will be saved in a Collection called *Todos*, which we will create soon.
- `addDoc` is a high-level method used to add data to a Collection.
- The `serverTimestamp` contains the values of both time and date values for each Document in a Collection.

We then need to import the **firebase.config.js** file in our **Todo.js** file to allow us to have access to the firebase methods:

```javascript
import { db } from '../services/firebase.config'
```

Using the import from our **firebase.config.js** file, we can now instantiate a reference to our Collection:

```javascript
const collectionRef = collection(db, 'todo');
```

- As seen in the code above, we created a variable called `collectionRef`. The `collectionRef` variable takes in the collection method. This method has two arguments. The first argument called `db` references the firebase service, while the second argument will create a new Collection called **todo**, which will contain all necessary **Documents** created.

Next, we create two variables using the `useState` hook:

```javascript
const [createTodo, setCreateTodo] = useState("")
```

- The first thing we did here is to import the useState hook in React:
  `import React, { useState } from 'react'`.
- Then we created a getter and a setter called `createTodo` and `setCreateTodo` respectively.
To proceed, we move to the modal created within the JSX and implement the next couple of things:
  - Within the form tag, we create an `onSubmit` event handler called `submitTodo`.
  `<form className="d-flex" onSubmit={submitTodo}>`
  - In the input tag within the form tag, we create an `onChange` event handler that allows us to get the value typed inside of the form:

```javascript
onChange={(e) => setCreateTodo(e.target.value)}`
```

The final implementation we need to make before adding data to the database becomes functional is to configure the `onSubmit` event handler previously created. The code for this can be seen below:

```javascript
  //Add Todo Handler
const submitTodo = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();

  try {
    await addDoc(collectionRef, {
      todo: createTodo,
      isChecked: false,
      timestamp: serverTimestamp()
    })
    window.location.reload();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
```

- Above, we made the `submitTodo` variable asynchronous by making use of the `async/await` keyword in `JavaScript`.
- We then created a parameter in the arrow function called `e`, which serves as an event. This ensures we can make use of the `e.preventDefault()` method which prevents the form from reloading after submission.
- Next within the `try/catch` block, we call the `addDoc` method which takes two arguments. The first argument is the `collectionRef` variable we created previously, while the second argument contains the object to be passed into the **firestore** database.
These objects include the **todo** values inside of the input field, the **checkbox** value which is currently set as false, and then the **timestamp** in which the todo was created in the database.
- We then make use of the `window.location.reload()` function in `JavaScript` to refresh the form upon successful submission while making use of catch to handle the error.
With this, we can now create a new **todo** and view it in our database.
{% img "condition.gif" "Creating the Todo" "lazy" %}

## Fetching Data from the Firestore in React

To fetch the data from the Firestore in Firebase, we need to make two importation in our **Todo.js** file. These include the `useEffect` hook in React and the `getDocs` from `firebase/firestore`:

```javascript
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { collection, addDoc, serverTimestamp, getDocs } from 'firebase/firestore'
```

We then need to create the setter(`setTodo`) and getter(`todos`) variables to help us access the data from the Firestore:

```javascript
const [todos, setTodo] = useState([])
```

The data can now be fetched inside of the `useEffect` hook:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
const getTodo = async () => {
  await getDocs(collectionRef).then((todo) => {
    let todoData = todo.docs.map((doc) => ({ ...doc.data(), id: did }))
    setTodo(todoData)
    }).catch((err) => {
      console.log(err);
    })
  }
getTodo()
}, [])
```

- Inside the `useEffect` hook, we created a variable called `getTodo` that takes in an asynchronous arrow function.
- Then we called the `getDocs` method from Firebase. The `getDocs` method requires an argument, so we pass in the `collectionRef`.The `getDocs` returns a promise which we need to chain to using `.then`.
- The promise returns an array that we need to map through to access the required data from the database, which are the **todo** list items as well as the `id`.
- The `todoData` variable holds the data coming from the database. To have access to the data in our JSX, we will then put the `todoData` as an argument in our setter which is called `setTodo`.
- We then proceed to handle the error by using the `catch` keyword before we finally call the `getTodo` function to initialize it on page load.

Now that we have access to our data from the database, we need to make it visible on the page. The data we have comes in form of an array and we need to loop through it in the **HTML** file. This will be done within the `div` with the `className` of `todo-list` as seen below:

```javascript
{todos.map(({ todo, id }) =>
  <div className="todo-list" key={id}>
    <div className="todo-item">
      <hr />
      <span>
        <div className="checker" >
          <span className="" >
            <input
              type="checkbox"
            />
          </span>
        </div>
        &nbsp;{todo}<br />
        <i>10/11/2022</i>
      </span>
      <span className=" float-end mx-3">
        <EditTodo /></span>
    <button
      type="button"
      className="btn btn-danger float-end">Delete
    </button>
    </div>
  </div>
)}
```

- In the code above, we call the `todos` getter that contains our data which comes in an array format.
- Next, we make use of the map array method to loop through the data, restructured the data by making use of curly brackets `{}`, and then extract the `todos` as well as the `id`.
- Finally, we called the `key` attribute in React, and pass in the `id` so as enable React to track the data loaded on the page. The static text beside the `&nbsp;` also gets cleared before replacing it with the todo data.

We can now proceed to save our changes.

## Deleting Data from the Firestore in React

To implement the delete functionality, we need to import two firestore functions which are `doc`, and `deleteDoc`.

```javascript
import { collection, addDoc, serverTimestamp, getDocs, doc, deleteDoc } from 'firebase/firestore'
```

Next, we create a function called `deleteTodo`:

```javascript
   //Delete Handler
const deleteTodo = async (id) => {
 try {
    window.confirm("Are you sure you want to delete this Todo?")
    const documentRef = doc(db, "todo", id);
    await deleteDoc(documentRef)
    window.location.reload();
    } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}

```

- Within the `try` block, we start by displaying a prompt to the user if they want to proceed to delete the Todo.
- We then create a new variable called `documentRef`. We then call the `doc` method which requires 3 arguments which are the firebase service, the collection name as well as the `todo id` that we want to delete.
- Next, we call the `deleteDoc` method from firestore and then pass in the `documentRef` as an argument. This will enable the specific todo to be deleted from the database. Once this is done, we refresh the page by calling the `window.location.reload();` function.
- We then use the `catch` block to handle any possible error by login into the console.

Now that our delete function is ready, all we have to do is to initialize it inside our delete button as seen below:

```javascript
<button
    type="button"
    className="btn btn-danger float-end"
    onClick={() => deleteTodo(id)}
      >Delete
</button>
```

- All we did was make use of the `onClick` event handler to call the `deleteTodo()` function anytime a specific todo is deleted. It should also be noted that the `id` parameter passed inside of the function was made accessible to us in the documentRef variable we created earlier.

## Updating Data in the Firestore in React

To implement the functionality to update data, we need to pass the data coming from the database as props to our `EditTodo.js` component:

```javascript
{todos.map(({ todo, id }) =>
   <div className="todo-list" key={id}>
     <div className="todo-item">
       <hr />
       <span>
         <div className="checker" >
           <span className="" >
             <input
               type="checkbox"
             />
           </span>
         </div>
         &nbsp;{todo}<br />
         <i>10/11/2022</i>
       </span>
       <span className=" float-end mx-3">
         <EditTodo todo={todo} id={id} />
       </span>
       <button
         type="button"
         className="btn btn-danger float-end"
         onClick={() => deleteTodo(id)}
       >Delete</button>
     </div>
   </div>
)}
```

We passed both the `todo` data as well as the `id` as props and it now becomes accessible in the `EditTodo.js` file.

Inside the `EditTodo.js`, we extract the data by making use of curly brackets `{}`:

```javascript
const EditTodo = ({ todo, id }) => {
```

We then make the necessary imports required to update the data, which include the following React and firebase terms:

- `useState` (React Hook)
- `db` (The Firebase Service instance)
- `doc` (The Firestore Document reference)
- `updateDoc` (Used to update a Document inside of a Collection)

The extracted data can now be set in state using the `useState` hook:

```javascript
const [todos, setTodos] = useState([todo])
```

- As seen above, we created new variables called `todos`, `setTodos`, and then set the initial value in the `useState` to the `todo` data coming from the database.

Next, we create the function that implements the update todo:

```javascript
const updateTodo = async (e) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  try {
    const todoDocument = doc(db, "todo", id);
    await updateDoc(todoDocument, {
      todo: todos
    });
    window.location.reload();
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(err);
  }
}
```

- Above, we created a variable called `updateTodo`, which holds the asynchronous arrow function.
- Next, we called the `e.preventDefault()`, to prevent the form from reloading.
- Then we create a `try/catch` block. Within the `try` block, we create a variable called `todoDocument`. This variable holds document reference which requires 3 arguments(`db`, `todo`, `id`). With this, we can update a specific todo from the firebase database using its `id`.
- In the next line, we call the `updateDoc` method that updates data in the firestore. This method takes two arguments. The first argument is the `todoDocument`, while the second is the updated todos text value which was the getter that was created earlier in the `useState` hook.
- Lastly, we refresh the page when the request is successful or display an error on the console if one occurs.

There are two implementations left to do. One is making the modal dynamic, while the other is calling our update data function in the **JSX**.

To make the modal dynamic, we need to change the values of the `id` in the **JSX**, so we add the following code:

```javascript
<button
  type="button"
  className="btn btn-primary"
  data-bs-toggle="modal"
  data-bs-target={`#id${id}`}      >
  Edit Todo
</button>

<div
  className="modal fade"
  id={`id${id}`}
  tabIndex="-1"
  aria-labelledby="editLabel"
  aria-hidden="true">
  <div className="modal-dialog">
  <div className="modal-content">
  <div className="modal-header">
  <h5 className="modal-title" id="editLabel">Update Todo Details</h5>
  <button type="button" className="btn-close" data-bs-dismiss="modal" aria-label="Close"></button>
</div>
```

- We begin by replacing the static text in the `data-bs-target` attribute called `#exampleModal`, with the dynamic `id` coming from the firestore.
- Within our modal, we replace the static id called `id="exampleModal"`, with the `id` from our firestore. The modal is now dynamic.

Next, to update the data, we need to call the `setTodos` setter inside the input field using the `onChange` event handler in React:

```javascript
<input
  type="text"
  className="form-control"
  defaultValue={todo}
  onChange={e => setTodos(e.target.value)}
/>
```

- The `defaultValue` helps to refill the form with the existing **todo** in the database.
- The `onChange` event handler helps to get the values of the input field and save it into the `setTodos` setter.

Finally, we can call the `updateTodo` function inside our submit button:

```javascript
<div className="modal-footer">
  <button
    type="button"
    className="btn btn-secondary"
    data-bs-dismiss="modal">
    Close
  </button>
  <button
    type="button"
    className="btn btn-primary"
    onClick={e => updateTodo(e)}
  >Update Todo</button>
</div>
```

- As seen above, we can now successfully update a specific todo using the `onClick` event handler in React.

## How to Integrate the Checkbox Functionality

To begin the checkbox implementation, we will create a variable using the useState hook:

```javascript
const [checked, setChecked] = useState([]);
```

Next, we pass the data from the firestore into the setter called `setChecked` inside of the useEffect:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const getTodo = async () => {
  await getDocs(collectionRef).then((todo) => {
     let todoData = todo.docs.map((doc) => ({ ...doc.data(), id: doc.id }))
     setTodo(todoData)
     setChecked(todoData)
    }).catch((err) => {
      console.log(err);
    })
  }
  getTodo()
}, [])
```

In the JSX, we will extract the `isChecked` value in the database and use it to conditionally set the CSS class used to `line-through` a specific todo which signifies the todo is done as seen below:

```javascript
{todos.map(({ todo, id, isChecked }) =>
 <div className="todo-list" key={id}>
 <div className="todo-item">
 <hr />
 <span className={`${isChecked === true ? 'done' : ''}`}>
```

We proceed to configure the input field used for our checkbox by using the following code:

```javascript
<input
    type="checkbox"
    defaultChecked={isChecked}
    name={id}
    onChange={(event) => checkHandler(event, todo)}
/>
```

- Above we use the `defaultChecked` attribute to set the default value of the checkbox coming from the firestore which is a Boolean.
- Next, we pass the `id` into the name attribute.
- Using the `onChange` event handler, we set the event and the todo data into a function called `checkHandler`, which we will create and configure below:

```javascript
  //Checkbox Handler
const checkHandler = async (event, todo) => {
  setChecked(state => {
  const indexToUpdate = state.findIndex(checkBox => checkBox.id.toString() === event.target.name);
  let newState = state.slice()
  newState.splice(indexToUpdate, 1, {
  ...state[indexToUpdate],
  isChecked: !state[indexToUpdate].isChecked,
  })
  setTodo(newState)
  return newState
});
```

- The summary of the above function helps to track the state of a specific checkbox when checked and unchecked by using the `findIndex` method in JavaScript.
- We then create a variable called `newState`. This variable makes use of the `slice()` and `splice()` methods in JavaScript. The `slice()` method helps us to return the selected checkbox(s) in the array, as a new array, while the `splice()` method helps us to save only elements that were checked into the array.
- Next, we then save the newly modified array into the `setTodo` setter before we return data using the return keyword.

The final step we need to take is to save the selected checkbox values in the database. We will do this by, making use of the [runTransaction](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/manage-data/transactions) method in JavaScript. The `runTransaction` method will be called within the `checkHandler` function:

```javascript
 // Persisting the checked value
try {
  const docRef = doc(db, "todo", event.target.name);
  await runTransaction(db, async (transaction) => {
    const todoDoc = await transaction.get(docRef);
    if (!todoDoc.exists()) {
      throw "Document does not exist!";
    }
    const newValue = !todoDoc.data().isChecked;
    transaction.update(docRef, { isChecked: newValue });
  });
  console.log("Transaction successfully committed!");
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Transaction failed: ", error);
}
```

- The first thing we need to do is import runTransaction from `firebase/firestore`.
- We then checked the database if the particular document being queried exists or not. If it doesn't exist we throw a message that says "**Document does not exist!**".
- If the document exists, we call the `transaction.update` method and then pass in the value of the `isChecked` variable which then updates it in the firestore database.

## How to order Data by Timestamp in Firebase

To order the data in our firestore database, the first thing to do is to clear all the current data we currently have by deleting the entire collection on the Firebase Database. This will allow the newly created documents to get ordered correctly.

We then need to import two methods from `firebase/firestore` called `orderBy` and query by using the following imports:

```javascript
import { collection, addDoc, serverTimestamp, getDocs, doc, deleteDoc, runTransaction, orderBy, query } from 'firebase/firestore'
```

- The `orderBy` method helps to sort the data coming from the database in either ascending, descending, or timestamp in which the data was created. In our case, we will be making use of the latter, while the query method as the name implies allows us to query data from the database.

Next, within the `useEffect`, we will remove the `collectionRef` we passed as a parameter into the `getDocs` method and replace it with a newly created query variable as seen below:

```javascript
const q = query(collectionRef, orderBy('timestamp'))
          await getDocs(q).then((todo) =>{
```

- Above, we create a variable called `q`, which uses the `orderBy` method to sort the data by the in which they were created. We then pass this variable to the `getDocs` method that gets the data from the Database.

To conclude this project, we will display the date and time on which the todo was created on the browser:

```javascript
{todos.map(({ todo, id, isChecked, timestamp }) =>
```

- We begin by extracting the `timestamp` value from the database.

We then need to clear the static date value inside of the italics`(<li></li>)` tag:

```javascript
<i>{new Date(timestamp.seconds * 1000).toLocaleString()}</i>
```

- We created a Date object and then get the seconds from the `timestamp` while multiplying it by `1000`. This is because `JavaScript` works with time in `milliseconds`. We then proceed to use the `toLocaleString()` method to return the date object as a string.

With this, we have the result below:

{% img "query.png" "Results showing the todo by timestamp as well as the dates created" "lazy" %}

## Conclusion

You have now completed the tutorial! You now know the basics of how to create a To-do application using React and Firebase Database. Now you can proceed to build your own web app from scratch and then integrate additional functionalities like firebase login and sign-in, Firebase tools, firebase deploy, and other firebase services into your React application.
