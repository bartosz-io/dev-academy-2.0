                <p>Bartosz's experience is demonstrated in the Web Security program. I was pleased to go over the first few lessons and learn the theory behind Web Security. All the concepts learned were later put into practice with his great Angular application backed by a Node.js service. Although I'm a Spring Boot developer, I was able to apply all the principles and concepts of Web Security in my applications. Also, the live sessions are essential in this program to ask and respond questions and build a great community. The program is updated regularly with new modules, I can't wait for the Firebase Security one! Keep up the great work!</p>

                <p>Finding a complete and up to date Web security content is hard and time consuming, especially as a whole. With Web Security Academy, I found out a great opportunity to learn about security in depth both on client and server sides. The program's material isn't just a simple support to learn but provides good practices of a real world application. Bartosz is a great teacher and meetings with him and other students is part of the program, giving you the support from a whole community.</p>

                <p>I am very skeptical about online courses or courses in general. However, I have seen Bartosz on YouTube in some videos and decided to join the program because I was excited by the way it was structured. There were many topics I was already experienced in but I must say that I still learned a lot. Especially the Online Meetings and the knowledge exchange was a real added value and I would recommend this program to anyone. The content did not disappoint me and I learned exactly the things I needed to develop in this area. Good Job Bartosz!</p>

                <p>The program is really well built. It first guides you through the ways a SPA can be vulnerable and the ways those vulnerabilities can be fixed, then it teaches you how to implement those protection mechanisms with Angular, without getting stuck on general development questions too much. It also shows the backend parts of those protection mechanisms. After completing the program I feel confident that I can protect the webapps I develop.</p>

                <p>If you are looking for a training to take you from just a front-end developer to a full-stack Angular/Node.js, then this is it. I have been an Angular contractor for a couple of years now and still learned some valuable tips for the front-end but the back-end has been invaluable to me for understanding how to build a highly secure full-stack application. The teacher is always there to help and really does care about you achieving the best from the program. He takes time to explain concepts in excellent weekly meetings where you will meet a great bunch of developers from all around the world and bounce new ideas off each other. Far better than the other Angular security courses I have taken in the past.</p>

                <p>WebSecurity Academy is a great place to learn new skills or increase your current. The instructor is very kind and has a goal that you understand all the content, so there's a Community (Slack) that you'll be a part of so you can ask questions (or help answer them), talk personally with the instructor, and get to know the other students. One thing I really like about this program is that it's paced over a certain amount of time. You won't be overwhelmed with On-Demand videos, although later you'll have on-demand access forever, which also nice! Overall, I give this 5 out of 5 stars!</p>
