## Article Contribution

To contribute with some article, follow the next steps:

1. Find a topic (in your preferable tech stack - Angular, React, Vue, Node.js,  etc.) related to:
    - web application security for developers
    - testing and automation (unit tests, DevOps, etc)
2. Join Dev Academy [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/tXrGY7ca43) to become a contributor
3. Clone this repository and create a new branch with a name like `new-article/name-of-the-article` (locally).
4. Once you have an article and his body in mind, we will give you access to a `Surfer SEO` text editor. `Surfer SEO` will helps you to write crazy articles with a terrific SEO impact üöÄ
5. Meanwhile, add you as a new author, go to `_config.yml` and add a new contributor entry at `contributors` (respecting the YAML format), something like this:

```yml
  "John Doe": # Your name as a key or id
    slug: john-done 
    desc: Here goes your great description. # Write a good description
    specs: [javascript, vue, nodejs, python, react] # More or less if you want
    image: /img/contributors/john-doe.jpeg # Choose your best pic and add it at this path
    motto: Here goes your motto. # A motivational phrase, your mantra
    joined: 01 Jan 2023 # Your join date 
    academies:          # If you are in some academy at dev-academy.com change it to true
      wsa: false        # Web Security Academy
      fta: false        # Full Testing Academy
    socials:  # URLs from Social Networks, Blogs, Personal Websites...
      site: https://john-done.github.io/
      github: https://github.com/john-done
      twitter: https://twitter.com/john-done
      linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-done
```

6. Commit the changes with a message like `feat: new author`
7. Write your article in `Surfer SEO` which is a friendly text editor like Word or Google Docs, but you will receive constant feedback on the SEO impact on a scale of 0 to 100 (that is the nice thing), try to reach 72 points at least if you want good results.
8. Use a FREE version of [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/browser/chrome) for fix all the grammar issues while the content is still in `Surfer SEO`.
9. Once you have done the article, go to tools and choose `Download content as HTML`.
10. This project needs articles written in Markdown. So, you have to convert HTML to Markdown, go to this [page](https://codebeautify.org/html-to-markdown), and convert it.
11. Now you have two ways to create an article. First one is recommended.
    - In the root of the project run npm task `npm run article --slug csurf-vulnerability`. Adjust the slug to the URL of your article after `--slug` argument. This is mandatory. Once done, a new article will be created with its contents together with a folder in `source/_posts`. Now you can copy your content inside auto-generated article.
    - Or go to the `source/_posts` directory path, create a readme file called as your article in the `kebab case format` (e.g. `source/_posts/csurf-vulnerability.md`), and copy the content of your converted article. But you will be also forced to add a new folder for the assets of the article and front matter inside the article.
12. You need to create a directory called `source/_posts/csurf-vulnerability` (as your article Markdown .md file). If you used `npm run article --slug csurf-vulnerability` you don't have to be worried about it. Add article images there. @bartosz-io will give you a main image of the post `banner.png` file to paste into this directory.
13. Now it's the time to complete **front matter** inside the article. If you run `npm run article --slug csurf-vulnerability`, all the props are already there. You will only need to modify them. Otherwise, you will need to copy the front matter yourself, e.g. from below.
```yml
---
title: What‚Äôs the problem with the CSURF package? # Title of the post, and also as a meta title
contributor: Mauricio Matias C. # Your full name. This value must be same as in the `_config.yml`
avatar: mauricio-matias.jpeg # Name of your profile picture (it comes from img/contributors)
description: The csurf library has insecure design issues. What can we do? # Meta description
date: 2022-11-24 # Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
tags: [node, security] # Post tags, must be lowercase
id: csurf-vulnerability # ID of the post, this is needed later for related posts (make sure this value is unique)
relatedPost: vue-security-best-practices # Optional, but if you see a relation with other post you can add its id here
---
{% image_fw 1.78 banner.png "csurf vulnerability" %}
```
14. After you pasted and added your content into article, the markdown file that you already paste needs some treatments.
    - Run [Markdown lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) in your preferable IDE
    - Apply the changes described below: üëá

- Change the `h2` heading style from:

```md
Vanilla JavaScript Style
------------------------
```
to:
```md
## Vanilla JavaScript Style
```

- After that, add a table of contents at the top of your article. If you run npm script before `npm run article`, then you can skip this step.

```md
## Table of Contents
<!-- toc -->
```

- Replace the markdown image way to get images from an external URL to a format that needs this blog system (download the image and paste it at your images directory, remember, you've created at step number 10) from:

```md
![simple react component, single logic example](https://images.surferseo.art/5b6d9719-266f-4f93-a999-44d81fc570cf.png)
```

to this format (the large message will be the `alt` property of the `<img>` HTML tag when the blog will be at production):

```md
{% img "simple_example.png" "simple react component, single logic example" "lazy" %}
```

15. Highlight your code by using only two ways:
- inline with markdown ticks `let a = 20`
- or as a block code by using three ticks and language name after (html, css, typescript, js, jsx, bash etc.). `\``typescript <<my-content>> ```

16. Before committing, ensure that the post meets these requirements:
    > ### Technical requirements
    > - Validate your metadata in `_config.yml` and article front matter if everything is correct.
    > - Make sure you added your profile image in `themes/my-theme/source/img/contributors`.
    > - Avatar and your full name must match with _config.yml.
    > - Add one tag name at least in metadata of the post.
    > - Add `relatedPost` id to another post if you see some relation.
    > - Do not forget about unique ID of your post.
    > - Do not add these props to article metadata: `bannerHeader`, `bannerSubheader`.
    > ### Article content requirements
    > - The first element of the article's content is always the main image e.g. `{% image_fw 1.78 "banner.png" "The csurf vulnerability" %}`, provided by @bartosz-io to you.
    > - Never add `lazy` attribute to the main first image.
    > - Add always `lazy` attribute to every image in your post beside first one.
    > - Never add `<h1>` header. You can only add `<h2>, <h3>, <h4>..` Add them neatly and in the correct order.
    > - Add always introduction of the post (few sentences).
    > - Article's content should contain at least **3 images**. They can be any presentational images like: infographics, illustration of a thesis, text cut out in a nice frame, quote, graphs, memes, screenshots. Be creative!
    > - Make sure your images are readable and looks good on mobile.
    > - Do not add too much external links.
    > - If you add some items then use lists. Make also use of blockquotes, code formatters. More your can find [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). See also how other contributors write their posts.
    > - Emphasize only keywords or something your really want to stress. Do not abuse it.
    > - If you see possibility then link to other content and posts inside *dev-academy.com*
    > - Try to fascinate others during reading, share your experiences in the posts.
    > - Don't create long paragraphs.
    > - Optimize your images. You can use online tools for that.
    > - **Don't plagiarise or copy & paste** because we check the credibility of the articles in online tools.
    > - Article should always end with conclusion or summary (few sentences).
    > - Texts are not written, texts are designed. Design your post to be proud of what you have created!
